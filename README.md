The notebook can be found [here](./notebooks/recreateEnpactResults.qmd)

In addtion, we provide access to the following pipelines to generate the data used in the paper:
1. To develop DL-based predictors of TF binding: use this pipeline: https://github.com/hakyimlab/TFpred-snakemake
2. To run TFXcan, use this pipeline: https://github.com/hakyimlab/TFXcan-snakemake
