## TFXcan

This repo contains scripts for the TFXcan (transcription factor binding prediction and correlation with complex traits) method

[./enformer-predict](./enformer_predict/) contains scripts used to predict using ENFORMER given some regions or intervals. The scripts in there can be used for personalized as well as reference predictions.

1. To develop DL-based predictors of TF binding: use this pipeline: https://github.com/hakyimlab/TFpred-snakemake

2. To run TFXcan, use this pipeline: https://github.com/hakyimlab/TFXcan-snakemake
