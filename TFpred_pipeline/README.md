## Introduction
This folder contains the entire TFPred pipeline. 
- [pipeline_cistrome.qmd](./pipelines/pipeline_cistrome.qmd) is used to process cistrome data, and is currently the reference set for training e.t.c.
- [pipeline_freedman.qmd](./pipelines/pipeline_freedman.qmd) is used to process freedman data, and is currently the set used for testing e.t.c.
- [pipeline_random.qmd](./pipelines/pipeline_random.qmd) is used to process freedman data, and is currently the set used for testing e.t.c. 

## Usage
